# Deep-Learning-with-Mnist

You are required to create a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in TensorFlow, implemented in Python, for classifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.


Dataset: MNIST - This classic dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) for training and 25,000 for testing. Each image is 28x28 pixels. 

DNN Architecture: 
•	Input Layer: 784 neurons (28x28 image flattened) 
•	Hidden Layers: 2 hidden layers with 128 neurons each using ReLU activation 
•	Output Layer: 10 neurons (one for each digit) using Softmax activation 
Steps: 
1.	Import Libraries: Start by importing TensorFlow and other necessary libraries like NumPy and matplotlib. 
2.	Load Data: Load the MNIST dataset using tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(). Split the data into training and testing sets. 
3.	Preprocess Data: Normalize pixel values between 0 and 1 by dividing by 255. 
4.	Define Model: Create a sequential model with the specified input, hidden, and output layers. Choose appropriate activation functions and add layers using model.add(). 
5.	Compile Model: Compile the model by specifying the optimizer (e.g., Adam), loss function (categorical_crossentropy), and metrics (e.g., accuracy). 
6.	Train Model: Train the model on the training data using model.fit(). Set epochs (number of training iterations) and batch size. 
7.	Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using model.evaluate(). Analyze accuracy and other metrics. 
8.	Visualize Results: You should visualize predictions on some test images using tools like matplotlib.
 
Additional Challenges: 
•	Try experimenting with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of neurons, learning rate, epochs) to improve accuracy. 
•	Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting. 
•	Add regularization techniques like Dropout to improve generalization. 
•	Explore deeper architectures with more hidden layers or convolutional layers for better performance.
